Instructions for use:
=====================

solder black wire on GND
solder red wire on 5V
solder any colored wire on Din (Data-in)

On the breadboard, attach a 300-500-Ohm resistor between the Din wire and the Digital I/O pin you will be using (Pin 6 in example code)

connect black to GND
connect red to 5V
connect Din wire (your choice of color) to the breadboard such that electricity will flow from Digital I/O pin through resistor to NeoPixel Strip
